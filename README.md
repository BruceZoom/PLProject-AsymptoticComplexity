# PL-Project
The project for programming language course.
## Compilation Order
Imp8 -> PolyAB -> Denotation -> HoareLogic -> Soundness
- AsymptoticBound is not used yet.
- Example is not included yet.

## File Description
- Imp8: basic library of the toy language, from the course
- PolyAB: defines polynomial and its operation, and asymptotic bounds defined on polynomials, and mathematic lemmas used later
- Denotation: the denational semantics with steps, from the course
- HoareLogic: the hoare logic with asymptotic bound, should contain rules and provable definition
- Soundness: the proof for the soundness of hoare logic
- Example: examples of programs proved using our hoare logic
- AsymptoticBound: pure mathematic asymptotic bound definition attempts (abandonded)
